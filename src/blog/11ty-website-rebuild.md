title: 'Yet another website rebuild - 11ty'

So I decided to rebuild my website... I've stuck to the Jamstack but this time I've decided to use the static site generator Elevently. In this post I wanted to cover how I came to this descision and what my inital thoughts of 11ty are.

## What I was using before

Previously, I was using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) hooked up to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). At the time I chose to use Gatsby because I had just started to become interested in static site generators and the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), Gatsby was the obvious choice as I had prior experience with React.

There wasn't much content on the website, just some of my projects and the details to contact me. It was good for hosting my portfolio but was lacking in personality _for sure_. I did enjoy setting up contentful and it was great to be able to update content without having to update the repository for the website. I definitely want to explore that again and get some sort of CMS hooked up to this website, I'm leaning towards Netlify CMS **- more on that soon ðŸ˜„**

## Why did I decide to rebuild

The Gatsby site served it's purpose for almost 2 years, in the time since launch I mainly focused on client work and subsequently I had picked up new preferences and practices for building websites. I wasn't really happy with the design of the website, the primary colour was a very saturated purple for some reason and everything was just a bit too big. I had new content I wanted to start putting out (such as posts like this) and wanted to refresh my personal branding, so I decided to go for a full rebuild.

React/Gatsby are great, and I would use both again. But for my personal website which is almost entirely static I felt that React was a bit overkill and the build times were frustrating at times. I played around with Eleventy a bit and decided to give it a try.

## Eleventy / 11ty

Eleventy is also static site generator (like Gatsby). It's super flexible and it has zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript. So it allows me to have fine-grained control and set up my codebase exactly how I want.

I configured 11ty to use Nunjucks for templating and markdown for my page content / posts. There's a few features I have sprinkled in which allow the site to load really fast:

- Seperated styling between components and served minified, inline to respective pages along with site-wide styles
- Used a cool trick to [asynchronously load font css](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/async-css.html#async-css-loading-approaches), this is why you can see the font change when loading this page
- On top of that, I've minified the final html output

I want to keep the performance a main priority for this website so I'm keeping it in mind with anything I add, I haven't used images much at all which has helped but I do plan to get some in.

## Simply put

The transition to 11ty was 100% worth it. It took me a few days to get everything in place and I'm glad it's live. 11ty has so much to offer and I want to fully utilise the features that come with it. My site has scored 100 in all areas of lighthouse, so I aim to get it on the [Eleventy Leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) next!
