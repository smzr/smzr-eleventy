## Initial idea
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton. The evolution is determined by the initial state and requires no further input. You can interact with the game by starting with a clear canvas and clicking to change the state of each cell.

I wanted to create this to play around with javascript.

## Result
This is a small project that uses a bit of math to incorporate the rules of the Game of Life. The user can control the game by changing the initial state or just leave it random.
