## Initial idea
I made Playlist Converter for my A-Level computing project. The idea was that I wanted to be able to take every song from a Spotify playlist and put them into an identical playlist on YouTube. This was the first big project I had done using API integration. I wanted the application to be easy to use and avoid too many steps.

## Result
Built with React.js and Passport.js for authentication, Playlist Converter is a web application which converts a Spotify playlist into a Youtube playlist. Made possible using the Spotify API and the YouTube API. There are a few playlist manipulation features on the interface including shuffling songs, removing songs, clearing all songs and adding custom songs.
