## Initial idea
I had the idea when trying to play the daily puzzle games myself, it was confusing trying to remember the names of all of them. I thought it could be a fun to make a simple [directory website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_directories) which was a popular concept 10-20 years ago!

I thought that "portle" would be a good domain name for the concept, seen as the daily puzzle sites tend to follow the spelling theme of wordle with the "-le" suffix. I had a look to see if any domains were available and came across [portle.to](https://portle.to/) which was too good not to claim.

## Result
I built the website on the same technologies that my personal website is built on (as of 14/04/2022). The website uses the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) which is read from the github repository and built by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on demand.
